# TemPace


A song that doesn't quite fit the mood of working out can ruin the entire experience. We love music and running and want to make sure they're working perfectly in sync.

Tempace takes the Health Data exported from the iOS health app, parses it to extract Running data, analyses it to remove useless data and group running sessions noted separately in the data file as one and uses a relation between song bpm and running pace to suggest songs for various intervals of the workout.
